 This subset request is based on the specification of a tributary area.
 For 1 & 2 degree products the resulting area is the defined by the
 bounding box of the 1/8 degree catchment.  Please see the latitude
 & longitude bounds, and dimensions above for the spatial extent of
 1 & 2 degree products, which is a rectangular area (see Area within
 bounds).  Please note that this rectangular area may be much larger
 than that of the 1/8 degree catchment.
